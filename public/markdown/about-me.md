# About Me

## Introduction

Hey there! 👋

I'm a B.Tech student at the [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://www.bitsathy.ac.in) department of [Bannari Amman Institute of Technology](https://www.btsathy.ac.in/).

💡 I love working on AI-powered applications, including emotion-based recommendation systems, NLP models, LSTM-driven EV battery prediction, and automation tools. I enjoy taking ideas from scratch to deployment — from model development to backend APIs to clean UI.

⚙️ As a self-driven AI & backend developer, I’ve built multiple real-world projects using Python, FastAPI, TensorFlow, Docker, and cloud services, always focusing on reliability, scalability, and meaningful impact.

📚 My learning philosophy is simple: build, break, learn, and improve. That’s how I’ve strengthened my skills across machine learning, deep learning, full-stack development, and cloud deployment.

🌱 Currently exploring Generative AI, LLMs, and modern deployment workflows, while constantly experimenting with new ideas and pushing myself as a developer.
